 🎵 Spotify Dataset Analysis

This project explores and analyzes Spotify music data to uncover trends and patterns related to songs, artists, popularity, and audio features.  
The goal is to gain insights into what makes songs popular and how musical characteristics vary across genres and years.

 Project Overview

In this analysis, I used Python for data wrangling, visualization, and statistical insights.  
The dataset contains detailed information about Spotify tracks such as:

- Track Name  
- Artist Name  
- Genre  
- Popularity
- Duration  
- Release Year  

 Objectives

- Understand the distribution of audio features like Genre, and Artist Name  
- Identify **trends over time** (e.g., how music characteristics have changed by year)  
- Analyze **popularity patterns** among genres and artists  
- Explore correlations between variables (e.g.,how does high Artist name mean high popularity?)

- There is a **positive correlation between Genre releases and the popularity**  
- Over the years, **average song duration has decreased**  
- **Popularity** is influenced by multiple features but not directly proportional to tempo or loudness
